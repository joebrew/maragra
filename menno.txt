Specify private SECTOR not just private

Include healthcare costs / clinic costs
	- Productivity 
	- Cost of providing health care
	- Replace current terms (abs. health, etc.)
	- Use language of "investor"

"We simply only consider those workers who ever got IRS.": we could/should include never-IRS workers, since they help to identify seasonal trend.
	- Even if a fixed-effect for worker model, they can still contribute to non-IRS determinants of absenteeism

Need to interact time
Treat time as a function, potentially with depreciation / decay parameter
Consider inclusion of worker fixed effects

Use linear probability model instead of logistic
