@article{Bloom2008,
abstract = {Health is a direct source of human welfare and also an instrument for raising income levels. We discuss a number of mechanisms through which health can affect income, focusing on worker productivity, children’s education, savings and investment, and demographic structure. As well as the impact of current illness, health may have large effects on prospective lifespans and life cycle behavior. Studies suggest there may be a large effect of health and nutrition in utero, and in the first few years of life, on physical and cognitive development and economic success as an adult. Macroeconomic evidence for an effect on growth is mixed, with evidence of a large effect in some studies. However, there is a possibility that gains from health may be outweighed by the effect of increased survival on population growth, until a fertility transition occurs. The low cost of some health interventions that have large‐scale effects on population health makes health investments a promising policy tool for growth in developing countries. In addition, higher priority could be given to tackling widespread “neglected” diseases—that is, diseases with low mortality burdens that are not priorities from a pure health perspective, but that do have substantial substantial effects on productivity.},

Given the often large variation in estimates across choices of control variables, functional forms, and other modeling assumptions, how can researchers ensure that the few estimates presented are accurate or representative? How do readers know that publications are not merely demonstrations that it is <jats:italic>possible</jats:italic> to find a specification that fits the author’s favorite hypothesis? And how do we evaluate or even define statistical properties like unbiasedness or mean squared error when no unique model or estimator even exists? Matching methods, which offer the promise of causal inference with fewer assumptions, constitute one possible way forward, but crucial results in this fast-growing methodological literature are often grossly misinterpreted. We explain how to avoid these misinterpretations and propose a unified approach that makes it possible for researchers to preprocess data with matching (such as with the easy-to-use software we offer) and then to apply the best parametric techniques they would have used anyway. This procedure makes parametric models produce more accurate and considerably less model-dependent causal inferences.</jats:p>}, number={3}, journal={Political Analysis}, publisher={Cambridge University Press (CUP)}, author={Ho, Daniel E. and Imai, Kosuke and King, Gary and Stuart, Elizabeth A.}, year={2007}, pages={199–236}}
