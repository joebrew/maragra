- precipitation vs. incidence (or other indicators): precip
- fixed effects and generalizability
- fixed effects and other controls
- "secular" trends in decline
- CONSIDER: (i) fixed effect for "holiday" season (jan-dec); (ii) remove holiday season as form of robustness check
- SHOW IN PAPER: over time chart of precipitation and incidence
- monthly data and converting to "protection" scores
- monthly and rainy day effects

- Use daily model keeping 0-1 and see what happens (taking into account the rainy day)
- Look at different variations: flood, dry, extremes, daily, etc.
